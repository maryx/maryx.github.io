        text: 'Given a list of sentences or phrases in various languages, how can we determine what language each sentence is in? If given a large amount of training data and dictionaries for each language, it is possible to just search for the words in the sentence. However, what about words that do not appear in the training data? What if we have only a small amount of training data? What about words that appear in multiple languages? Here, you are given sentences and phrases in the official European Union languages (Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish), and 16 other languages (Afrikaans, Catalan, Esperanto, Icelandic, Indonesian, Kurdish, Malay, Norwegian (Bokmal), Russian, Swahili, Turkish, Vietnamese, Welsh, Zulu). Your goal is to determine the language of each sentence/phrase out of these 38 languages. Overall, these languages incorporate the Latin, Cyrillic, or Greek, alphabet. (Note that Google Translate can detect from among 80 languages.)'
